                JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming
                language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and
                multi-paradigm.

                <br><br>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.
                JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast
                majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
                execute it.

                <br><br>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including
                object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays,
                dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include
                any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host
                environment in which it is embedded.

                <br><br>Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many
                other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web
                programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript
                available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.
